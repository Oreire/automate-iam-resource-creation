# Automated, Scalable and Secure Identity and Access Management in AWS with Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

# Introduction

Effective Identity and Access Management (IAM) is crucial for organizations, as it enhances security, operational efficiency, and regulatory compliance. IAM defines who can access resources, what actions they can perform, and how permissions are monitored, making it a foundational element in risk mitigation and organizational productivity.

By implementing robust IAM policies, organizations can protect sensitive data, streamline user access, and enforce governance standards, creating a secure and efficient IT environment. Beyond reinforcing security, auditability, and compliance with frameworks such as GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, and ISO 27001, organizations must also ensure IAM scalability to support expanding infrastructures and dynamic workloads.

To achieve this, organizations should adopt programmatic deployment methods, using IaC for IAM management. Implementing IAM through Terraform or similar IaC tools ensures consistency, automation, and efficiency, enabling seamless access control across complex cloud environments. This approach reduces manual errors, streamlines administrative tasks, and allows rapid permission adjustments, ensuring governance enforcement and continuous security without compromising scalability or compliance.



# Project Summary

Hence, this project explores the application of IaC for the automated provisioning of EC2 instances, IAM users, IAM roles, IAM policies and access keys using Terraform. By leveraging IaC, organizations can enhance security, maintain consistency, and minimize manual intervention when managing multiple user accounts. Defining IAM user policies and permissions as code allows for standardized access control, reducing configuration errors and improving operational efficiency within AWS environments. This approach not only streamlines user provisioning and enhances scalability but also reinforces best practices in identity management, access control, and governance, ensuring compliance and security across cloud infrastructures.

However, it MUST be stated that the scripts employed some **Advanced Terraform Features** of terraform for the implemnetation: 

  # Count, Locals blocks, Dynamic blocks, For_each, Depends on and Backend Terraform State

**1. Prerequisites**

# Before automating IAM user creation, ensure:
    
    - Terraform is installed.
    - AWS credentials (Access Key & Secret Key) are configured.
    - Enable necessary permissions for the creation of IAM users.

**2. IAM Policy Attachments**  

#### **Purpose:**  
    
    - Uses **JSON policy encoding** (`jsonencode()`) for IAM permissions.  
    - Grants IAM users **`DescribeInstances`** access for EC2 and **`ListBucket`** access for S3.  
    - Dynamically applies IAM policies using `for_each`.  

**3. IAM Access Key Automation**  

#### **Purpose:**  

    - Creates **IAM access keys** dynamically for users (`for_each`).  
    - Uses a lifecycle policy (`create_before_destroy = true`) to preserve **access continuity**.  
    - Avoids exposing credentials using Terraform’s **`sensitive()` function**.  

**4. IAM Role Creation & Assignment**  

#### **Purpose:**  

    - Defines an **IAM role** that EC2 instances can **assume** (`sts:AssumeRole`).  
    - Grants the role permissions for **EC2 and S3 operations** via `aws_iam_role_policy`.  
    - Creates an **IAM instance profile** (`aws_iam_instance_profile`) to attach the IAM role to EC2         
      instances.

   # Security Improvements & Best Practices:**  

        1.	Multi-group implementations to further enhance scalability.

        2.	Secrets Handling using AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault to securely store credentials. 

        3.	Logging & Auditing – Implement CloudTrail logging to monitor IAM changes, ensuring accountability and security compliance.

        4.	Automated Monitoring – Set up AWS Config or GuardDuty to track anomalous IAM activities and 
            enforce security best practices.

        5.	CICD Implementation
